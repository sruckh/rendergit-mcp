Project GOALS

Take this project, https://github.com/karpathy/rendergit, and make its functionality available as an MCP server
The mcp server should take a github URL without needed https://github.com/ for example just using sruckh/ig_phantom should work.
The mcp server should call redergit to obtain LLM View: Raw CXML text format - perfect for copying to Claude/ChatGPT for code analysis
the LLM calling MCP server should be able to use the output from rendergit as conversation context.

Use context7 mcp server to get documentation when more current information is needed
Use fetch to get data from external websites
Ask serena for memories when you need more context
Ask claude flow to launch agents when more complex work is required.

Use the github repository sruckh/rendergit-mcp for this project.  Always use SSH when talking to github.
