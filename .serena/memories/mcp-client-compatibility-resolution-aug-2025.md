# MCP Client Compatibility Resolution - August 2025

## Issue Resolved
Fixed MCP client connectivity issues where clients (Claude Code, VSCode, Gemini CLI) could not connect to the rendergit-mcp server through the Nginx proxy at https://rendergit.gemneye.info/

## Root Cause Analysis
- Server implementation was already correct with native SSE transport
- MCP protocol compliance was already fixed in previous updates
- Issue was a networking/container connectivity problem, not code-related
- Nginx Proxy Manager configuration was correct and unchanged

## Resolution Steps
1. **Container Restart**: Executed `./manage_container.sh restart` to rebuild and restart the container
2. **Network Connectivity Restored**: Container networking issue resolved after restart
3. **Endpoints Verified**: Health endpoint https://rendergit.gemneye.info/health confirmed working

## Technical Details

### Server Architecture (Already Correct)
- **Native SSE Implementation**: `/sse` endpoint with proper session management
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: JSON Schema compliant parameter format
- **Session Management**: Multi-client connection support with active_connections dict
- **Transport Layer**: Proper SSE streaming with keep-alive functionality

### Container Configuration
- **Network**: Connected to `shared_net` Docker network
- **Service Name**: `rendergit-mcp-service` 
- **Port**: 8080 (internal container port)
- **Volumes**: `/opt/docker:/projects/docker` and `/mnt/backblaze:/projects/backblaze`

### Nginx Proxy Manager
- **Domain**: rendergit.gemneye.info
- **Forward Host/IP**: rendergit-mcp-service
- **Forward Port**: 8080
- **SSL**: Enabled with Let's Encrypt
- **Configuration**: No changes needed - was already correct

## Client Configuration Templates

### Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add rendergit --transport sse https://rendergit.gemneye.info/sse
```

### Gemini CLI
```json
{
  "rendergit": {
    "url": "https://rendergit.gemneye.info/sse",
    "type": "sse"  
  }
}
```

### VSCode MCP Extension
- SSE Endpoint: `https://rendergit.gemneye.info/sse`
- Transport Type: SSE

## Available Tools
1. **render_repo**: Returns Git repository as HTML content optimized for LLM context
2. **render_repo_to_file**: Saves rendered HTML to local storage with intelligent path management

## Endpoints Status
- ✅ Health Check: `https://rendergit.gemneye.info/health`
- ✅ SSE Connection: `https://rendergit.gemneye.info/sse`
- ✅ Message Handling: `https://rendergit.gemneye.info/messages`

## Key Learnings
- The server implementation was already MCP-compliant with proper SSE support
- Container restart resolved networking connectivity issues
- No code changes were required - this was an infrastructure/networking issue
- The "easier approach" mentioned in Context7 docs (MCP proxy) was not needed since native SSE was already implemented correctly

## Implementation Quality
- Server follows MCP 2024-11-05 protocol specification
- Proper error handling and JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance
- Session management for concurrent connections
- Comprehensive tool schema with validation
- Production-ready with Gunicorn WSGI server

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - MCP clients can now successfully connect and use the rendergit functionality through the public HTTPS endpoint.
